# Neilit
Neilit is my first personal project in the fintech arena, conceived as a hub of readily accessible features for traders in the foreign exchange market. Neilit was designed to equip traders with the necessary resources to increase the performance of their trading strategies. Some of the functionalities that were implemented in the project were storage for trading operations, note-taking functionalities, technical analysis dashboards, calculators for position size, and visual representations of data through graphs.
